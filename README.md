## Welcome to NoiseFinder for Northeastern Huskies!

This is a tool that allows students to find other Huskies who are looking to play/write/whatever music!

All you need to do is make an account, and then you can either browse the database manually, or see who is recommended to you!

No personal information is shared until you match up with another musician!

## Good luck!
